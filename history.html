<h2>Welcome to the history page of TBWE and other websites</h2>
<p class="centernews">On this page, old versions of TBWE and other websites can be found. I try to preserve the original code. However, if something breaks due to something missing, I may change some code. I might replace online images with local images. <b>Most games will not work on these historical websites!</b></p>

<h2>The Begining: TBWE1</h2>
<p class="centernews"><b>9/10-13/2019</b><br>In the begining, there were two. Those two being <a class="a11" href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">Notepad++</a> and a <a class="a11" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-USAeFpVf_A">youtube series.<a> This lead to the creation of my first (HTML) website, The Best Website Ever 1. See it <a class="a11" href="hfiles/history/tbwe1/Rob+Reid.html">here!</a> This was made for <b>Introduction to HTML Coding Project 1</b> in <b>IST Exploratory Group I.</b></p>
<br><p class="centernews"><b>11/7-12/2019</b><br>This was the first HTML assignment in IST Exploratory 4 Day: Group A 2023. This is a four part assignment.</p>
</div>
<div class="inset-border">
<br><h2>TBWE2</h2>
<p class="centernews">This was when TBWE started to become a good website. It was not an online website yet. It was made to be stored locally. It was created in IST 4 Day. The original is mostly HTML, but the second one (HTML 2a challenge) started using CSS and images. It was the start of all modern TBWEs, as they still use code from it. Later, I discovered how to unblock flash games from y8.com, which lead to the creation of TBWE3, which was meant to share the unblocked games.</p>   

<br><h3>k.html</h3>  
<p class="centernews">This was found in my Google Drive at My Drive/Other/. It was added on 12/10/2019. Little is known about this, it seems to use TBWE2's codebase and seems to be the same as some TBWE2s, exept there was no logo. It has now been deleted.</p> 
</div>
<br><h3>bjhbj</h3>  
<p class="centernews">This was found in my Google Drive at My Drive/Other/. It was added on 12/10/2019. Little is known about this, it seems to use TBWE2's codebase, but it does have a few differing parts. It was found as a generic file (no extension), but had HTML code. It has now been deleted.</p> 
</div>   
<div class="inset-border">    
<br><h2>TBWE3</h2>
<p class="centernews">This was when TBWE was shared. It was not an online website yet. It was made to be stored locally. Some shareware versions contain fewer files (as to not confuse the recipient) and were distributed by email.  </p>   
<br><h3>TBWE3.3 Shareware</h3>  
  <p class="centernews">This version of TBWE3 is shareware. It was found in my Google Drive at My Drive/Other/Websites/TBWE3.3 Shareware/ as shared directory. It was added on 2/11/2020. It has now been deleted.</p> 
<br><h3>ALEKS HTML and ALEKS HTML (1)</h3>  
  <p class="centernews">They are versions of TBWE3.2 full. They were found in my Google Drive at My Drive/Other/Websites/ALEKS HTML/ and My Drive/Other/Websites/ALEKS HTML (1)/ a. They were added on 1/30/2020 and 2/6/2020. They were made in math class. They have now been deleted from their original location.</p> 
<br><h3>Minecraft Online and Minecraft Online (1)</h3>  
  <p class="centernews">They are versions of an unknown TBWE3. They were found in my Google Drive at My Drive/Other/Websites/Minecraft Online/ and My Drive/Other/Websites/Minecraft Online (1)/ and they were both shared. They were added on 2/10/2020 and 2/11/2020. They were made to trick others into playing a game that is not minecraft. The games are Icy Tower Cat Mario; I found them on <a href="https://www.archive.org">archive.org.</a> They have now been deleted from their original location.</p> 
</div>
<div class="inset-border">
  <br><h2>Other Websites</h2>
<p class="centernews">This category cantains miscellaneous websites that are not part of the TBWE family.</p>   
<br><h3>CompUSA</h3>  
  <p class="centernews">CompUSA was made for trade. I was assigned the topic of CompUSA and created a website about it. I learned a signifigant amount of CSS. It eventually became TBWE4. The Theme is still used un TBWE5 and the failed online emulation website. It is unfinished becasue the trade cycle ended and corona hit.</p> 

<br><h3>Readinghtm_ 1 and Readinghtm_ 2</h3>  
  <p class="centernews">These were created for the trade English class. I created it because we were allowed to do an assignment on our trade, so I chose the topic of how to make a website. These are early, so they are not complete. They were found in My Drive/Other/Website/readinghtm_ and My Drive/Other/Website/readinghtm_/readinghtm_ </p>
