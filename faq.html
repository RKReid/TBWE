<h1>F.A.Q.</h1>
<p><b>Is this a virus?</b> - Maybe</p><br>
<p><b>How many Rick rolls are there?</b> - Yes</p><br>
<p><b>Why is [ENTER NAME] here?</b> - Because I had worked on it at somepoint</p><br>
<p><b>Why is my profile picture here and so low quality?</b> - Because I deemed it worthy to go to my website, or I'm using it for something. Quality may be ruined due to there not being a good way to copy that image.</p><br>
<p><b>Can I add something to this webiste?</b> - Whilst this was never asked, you can get me to add something by filling out the form on the contact page. Also most non-serious, non-large files I am sent will end up here.</p><br>
<p><b>The seasonal page is lagging!</b> - Not a question, but it normally does that. In fact if it doesn't lag, notify me.</p><br>
<p><b>What is orange Super Why?</b> - That's Proto and your security is his motto. Proto is the mascot of an Indian antivirus Protegent that may or may not work.</p><br>
<p><b>Should I invest in Dogecoin?</b> - Elon Musk supports it, so yes. So what if you lose your life savings on Dogecoin anyways?</p><br>
<p><b>Is the torrents page safe/legal?</b> - Safe? Maybe. Legal? Yes. I don't distribute the software, I distribute ways to get it, so legal.</p><br>
<p><b>Stop sending me emails about your website!</b> - That is not a question, so no.</p><br>
<p><b>What is TBWE6 going to be like?</b> - It will be amazing. PHP and JavaScript will be everywhere. I might even host it on one of my computers as well!</p><br>
<p><b>Is your Minecraft Server terrible?</b> - No, it can support up to 20,000,000 users.</p><br>
