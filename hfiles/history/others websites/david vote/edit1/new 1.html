  <h3>
  Hello, first off, I would like to thank you for actually reading the email,(if you didn't do that beforehand, then please do) and clicking on the link.
  </h3>
  <h3>
  Secondly, I would like to ask you to vote for me for the position of vice president. One of the reasons I deserve to have that position is that I have been in a leadership position before, and I know my limits, or rather, I know what I'm capable of. 
  </h3>
  <h3>
  Another reason is that I can keep a cool head when I'm being provoked. Because of that, I'm more likely to make rational decisions instead of just bursting out in anger or frustration. 
  </h3>
  <h3>
  A third reason is that I know and understand my flaws. I am well aware that I tend to be annoying at times, and I thank you all for dealing with me for this long(that is, if you know me at all). I will work to erase most of my flaws, and make my strengths much better.
  </h3>
  <h2>
  Now please enjoy the picture of a duck/horse hybrid, the majestic Dorse.
  </h2>
